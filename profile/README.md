## Project Overview

### Challenges in Traditional DFS Platforms

- **High Fees** : Traditional DFS platforms often charge substantial fees, reducing the potential winnings for participants.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Users often question the fairness of these platforms, with concerns about the opacity of algorithms and outcomes.
